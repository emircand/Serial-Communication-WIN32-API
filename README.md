ASSIGNMENT:

In this assignment you are required to write a C program on your computer that talks to Arduino in C language. To do that you need to:
a)	Write a code in C language on your pc to talk to arduino
b)	Write arduino code on arduino to talk to pc

Your program on PC will have a menu as follows:

## WELCOME TO GTU ARDUINO LAB        ##
## STUDENT NAME:               		   ##
## PLEASE SELECT FROM THE FOLLOWING  ##
## MENU :                            ##
(1) TURN ON LED ON ARDUINO 
(2) TURN OFF LED ON ARDUINO
(3) FLASH ARDUINO LED 3 TIMES
(4) SEND A NUMBER TO ARDUINO TO COMPUTE SQUARE BY ARDUINO
(5) Button press counter (bonus item)
(0) EXIT

(5) button press counter is a bonus question, requires hardware button connection to an input port. At each press of a button, number sent on computer screen will be incremented by one. We want to see if your program is capable of taking button pushes, thatâ€™s all.
